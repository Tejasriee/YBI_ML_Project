# 🧠 Student Performance Prediction using Python & Machine Learning

This project predicts student marks based on study hours using **Linear Regression**, a machine learning algorithm. It is a beginner-friendly ML project created as part of the **YBI Foundation Internship Program**.

---
## 📄 Project Description
- Predicts student marks based on the number of hours studied.
- Uses **Linear Regression** from **Scikit-learn**.
- Evaluates performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted marks using a **graph**.
- Added predictions for **new study hours** with a **table** for better understanding.

---
## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---
## 📊 Features
1. **Graph:** Scatter plot of actual vs predicted marks.
2. **MAE:** Mean Absolute Error to measure model accuracy.
3. **Predictions:** Predict marks for new study hours.
4. **Table:** Display predictions neatly in a table.

---
## 🔍 How to Run
1. Open the notebook `YBI_ML_Project.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run all code cells sequentially.
3. Check the outputs:
   - Graph of actual vs predicted marks.
   - MAE value.
   - Table with new predictions.

## 📎 Output Example
- **Graph:** Shows the regression line fitting the student data points.
- **MAE:** ~1.4 (depending on dataset)
- **Predicted Marks Table:**

| Study Hours | Predicted Marks |
|-------------|----------------|
| 11          | 95.00          |
| 12          | 100.00         |
| 13          | 105.00         |
